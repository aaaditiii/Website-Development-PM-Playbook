# Website-Development-PM-Playbook

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
This repository showcases a simulated end-to-end project plan I created for a fictional website redesign. My goal was to demonstrate how a Project Manager (like myself!) would plan, manage, and deliver a project while exploring how Generative AI (Gen AI) can be used to boost efficiency and cut down on repetitive work.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
Project Name: Website Redesign Initiative
My Role: Associate Solutions Engineer
Type: Personal Case Study
Methodology: Scrum
Tools I Used: ClickUp, Asana, ChatGPT, Excel, GitHub
AI Integration: I used Gen AI to help generate sprint plans, risk registers, stakeholder emails, summaries, and more. 

ðŸ“‚ Whatâ€™s Inside
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key files and folders in this project:

Project_Charter.md	The purpose of the project, goals, constraints, and success metrics
Scope_Statement.md	Whatâ€™s included (and excluded) from the projectâ€™s scope
Work_Breakdown_Structure.md	A detailed breakdown of tasks and deliverables
Risk_Register.md	Identified risks, their impact, and how I planned to handle them
Sprint_Backlog.md	Backlog of tasks organized by priority and sprint
Communication_Plan.md	How I planned to keep stakeholders informed throughout the project
AI_Prompts_Used.md	A list of prompts I used to get help from AI tools
Meeting_Minutes	Notes and action items from weekly project meetings

ðŸ¤– How I Used Gen AI
I wanted to explore how Generative AI can support real project tasks. Hereâ€™s how I used it in this case study:

1. Writing status reports

2. Summarizing meeting notes

3. Creating risk management documentation

4. Drafting stakeholder emails

5. Building sprint plans from user stories

You can find actual examples of AI prompts I used in the AI_Prompts_Used.md file.

ðŸ§  Why I Created This:
I built this project to showcase my understanding of Project Management principles and demonstrate my hands on skills with tools like ClickUp, Asana, ChatGPT, Excel, GitHub. Experiment with using Gen AI as a productivity partner in PM workflows. This portfolio project reflects both my learning journey and my curiosity about how AI is reshaping the future of work.

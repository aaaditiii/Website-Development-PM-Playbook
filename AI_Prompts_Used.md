# AI Prompts Used in This Project

Here are some of the prompts I used with ChatGPT and other AI tools:

- “Draft a project charter for a website redesign using Agile.”
- “Create a stakeholder communication plan template.”
- “Summarize these meeting notes into bullet points.”
- “Generate a sprint backlog based on a 6-week timeline.”
- “List common risks in web redesign projects with mitigation.”

These saved me time and helped me keep the documentation clear and consistent.
